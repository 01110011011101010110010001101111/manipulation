    <figcaption>Your challenge: command the robot to pick up the brick and place
    it in a desired position/orientation.</figcaption>

  </figure>

  <p>The stage is set.  You have your robot.  I have a little red brick.  I'm
  going to put it on the table in front of your robot, and your goal is to move
  it to a desired position/orientation on the table.  I want to defer the
  <i>perception</i> problem for one chapter, and will let you assume that you
  have access to a perfect measurement of the current position/orientation of
  the brick.  Even without perception, completing this task this requires us to
  build up a basic toolkit for geometry and kinematics; it's a natural place to
  start.</p>

  <p>First, we will establish some terminology and notation for kinematics. This
  is one area where careful notation can yield dividends, and sloppy notation
  will inevitably lead to confusion and bugs.  The Drake developers have gone to
  great length to establish and document a consistent <a
  href="https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/group__multibody__notation.html">
  multibody notation</a>, and have even included some of their
  motivation/philosophy. I'll adhere to that notation here.</p>
  
  <p>If you'd like a more extensive background on kinematics than what I provide
  here, my favorite reference is still <elib>Craig05</elib>.  For free online
  resources, Chapters 2 and 3 of the 1994 book by Murray et al. (now free
  online)<elib>Murray94</elib> are also excellent, as are the first seven
  chapters of <a
  href="http://hades.mech.northwestern.edu/index.php/Modern_Robotics">Modern
  Robotics</a> by Lynch and Park<elib>Lynch17</elib> (they also have excellent
  accompanying videos).  Unfortunately, with three different references you'll
  get three (slightly) different notations; mine is most similar to
  <elib>Craig05</elib>.</p>
    
  <p>Please don't get overwhelmed by how much background material there is to
  know!  I am personally of the opinion that a clear understanding of just a few
  basic ideas should make you very effective here.  The details will come
  later, if you need them.</p>    

  <section><h1>Notation</h1>

    <p><i>The following concepts are disarmingly subtle. I've seen incredibly
    smart people assume they knew them and then stumble over notation
    forevermore.  I did it for years myself.  Take a minute to read this
    carefully!</i></p>

    <p>Perhaps the most fundamental concept in geometry is the concept of a
    point.  Points occupy a position in space, and they can have names, e.g.
    point $A$, $C$, or perhaps $B_{com}$ for the center of mass of body $B$.
    We'll denote the position of the point as $p^A$; that's $p$ for position,
    and not for point, because other geometric quantities can also have a
    position.</p>

    <p>But let's be more careful.  Position is actually a relative quantity.
    Really, we should only ever write the position of two points relative to
    each other. We'll use e.g. $^Ap^C$ to denote the position of $C$ relative to
    $A$.  The left superscript looks mighty strange, but we'll see that it pays off once we start tranforming points.</p>
    
    <p><img style="height:90px;float:left;margin-right:10px"
    src="figures/coordinate_frames.png"/> Every time we describe the (relative)
    position as a vector of numbers, we need to be explicit about the coordinate
    system.  All of our coordinate systems here will follow the "right-hand rule".
    We'll give a coordinate system, coordinate frame, or just <i>frame</i>, a
    name, too, like $F$.  If I want to write the position of point $C$ relative
    to point $A$, expressed in frame $F$, I will write $[^Ap^C]_F$.  The
    brackets come in because we'll sometimes what to refer to the elements of
    the position, e.g. $[^Ap_i^C]_F$ is the $i$th element.</p>
    
    <p>That is seriously heavy notation.  I don't love it myself, but it's
    the most durable I've got, and we'll have shorthand for when the context is
    clear.</p>

    <p>There are a few very special frames.  We use $W$ to denote the <i>world
    frame</i>.  We think about the world frame in Drake using vehicle
    coordinates (positive $x$ to the front, positive $y$ to the <i>left</i>, and
    positive $z$ is up).  The other particularly special frames are the <i>body
    frames</i>: every body in the multibody system has a unique frame attached
    to it.  We'll typically use $B_i$ to denote the frame for body $i$.</p>

    <p>Frames have a position, too -- it coincides with the origin.  So it is
    perfectly valid to write $[^Wp^A]_W$ to denote the position of point $A$
    relative to the origin of the world frame, expressed in the world frame.
    Here is where the shorthand comes in.  If the position of a quantity is
    relative to a frame, and expressed in the same frame, then we can safely
    omit the brackets and the subscript.  $^Fp^A \equiv [^Fp^A]_F$.
    Furthermore, if the "relative to" field is omitted, then we assume that the
    point is relative to $W$, so $p^A \equiv [^Wp^A]_W$.</p>

    <p>Frames also have an orientation.  We'll use $R$ to denote a <i>rotation
    matrix</i>, and follow the same notation, writing $[^BR^A]_C$ to denote the
    rotation of frame $A$ relative to frame $B$, expressed in frame $C$.</p>

    <p>A frame $F$ can be specified completely by a position and rotation
    relative to another frame.  Taken together, we call the position and
    rotation a <a
    href="https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/classdrake_1_1math_1_1_rigid_transform.html"><code>RigidTransform</code></a>,
    and denote it with the letter $X$. When we talk about the <i>pose</i> of an
    object or frame, we mean the
    <code>RigidTransform</code> (relative to the world, if we are not more
    explicit). $[^BX^A]_C$ is the pose of $A$ relative to frame $B$, expressed
    in frame $C$.</p>

    <subsection><h1>Rotation representations</h1>
    
      <p>Quaternions, Euler angles, Axis angles, Rotation matrices.</p>
      <p>We'll get into them if/when we need to, but for now it's sufficient to
      understand that `RigidTransform`...</p>

  <section><h1>Forward kinematics</h1>
  
    <p>Each body has a frame.  (We can have additional frames).  So the probelm
    for forward kinematics is simply to compute $^W</p>
