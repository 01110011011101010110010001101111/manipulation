  <todo>Consider moving / teaching this BEFORE geometric pose estimation.  It could actually be nice to introduce cameras / point clouds with this material instead of with pose estimation.</todo>

  <p>Our initial study of geometric perception gave us some powerful tools, but
  also revealed some major limitations.  In the next chapter, we will begin
  applying techniques from deep learning to perception.  Spoiler alert: those
  methods are going to be insatiable in their hunger for data. So before we get
  there, I'd like to take a brief excursion into a nice subproblem that might
  help us feed that need.</p>

  <p>In this chapter we'll consider the simplest version of the bin picking
  problem: the robot has a bin full of random objects and simply needs to move
  those objects from one bin to the other.  We'll be agnostic about what those
  objects are and about where they end up in the other bin, but we would like
  our solution to achieve a reasonable level of performance for a very wide
  variety of objects.  This turns out to be a pretty convenient way to create a
  training ground for robot learning -- we can set the robot up to move objects
  back and forth between bins all day and night, and intermittently add and
  remove objects from the bin to improve diversity.  Of course, it is even
  easier in simulation!</p>

  <p>Bin picking has potentially very important applications in industries such
  as logistics, and there are significantly more refined versions of this
  problem. For example, we might need to pick only objects from a specific
  class, and/or place the objects in known position (e.g. for "packing").  But
  let's start with the basic case.</p>

  <section><h1>Generating random cluttered scenes</h1>
  
    <p>If our goal is to test a diversity of bin picking situations, then the
    first tasks is to figure out how to generate diverse simulations.  How
    should we populate the bin full of objects?  So far we've set up each
    simulation by carefully setting the initial positions (in the Context) for
    each of the objects, but that approach won't scale.</p>

    <subsection><h1>Falling things</h1>

      <p>In the real world, we would probably just dump the random objects into
      the bin.  That's a reasonable strategy for simulation, too.  We can
      roughly expect our simulation to be reasonable as long as our initial
      conditions are reasonable -- we can't have multiple objects occupying the
      same physical space.  The simplest an most common way around this is to
      generate a random number of objects in random poses, with their vertical
      positions staggered so that they trivially start out of penetration.</p>

      <p>If you look for them, you can find animations of large numbers of
      falling objects in the demo reels for most advanced multibody
      simulators.  But we're doing it for a purpose!</p>

      <todo>maybe cite the falling things paper, but make it clear that the idea
      is not new?</todo></p>

      <example><h1>Piles of foam bricks in 2D</h1>

        <p>Here is the 2D case.  I've added many instance of our favorite red
        foam brick to the plant.  Note that it's possible to write highly
        optimized 2D simulators; that's not what I've done here.  Rather, I've
        added a planar joint connecting each of them to the world, and run our
        full 3D simulator.  The planar joint has three degrees of freedom.  I've
        oriented them here to be $x$, $z$, and $\theta$) to constrain the
        objects to the 2D plane.</p>

        <p>I've set the initial positions for each object in the Context to be
        uniformly distributed over the horizontal position, uniformly rotated,
        and staggered every 0.1m in their initial vertical position.</p>

        </figure>

      </example>

      <p>It's not really any different to do this with any random objects --
      here is what it looks like when I run the same code, but replacing the
      brick with a random draw from a few objects from the <a
      href="https://www.ycbbenchmarks.com/">YCB dataset</a>.  It somehow amuses
      me that we can see the <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem">central limit
      theorem</a> hard at work, even when our objects are slightly
      ridiculous.</p>

      <figure>
      <img style="width:70%" src="data/ycb_planar_clutter.png"/>
      </figure>

      <example><h1>Filling bins with clutter</h1>

        <p>The same technique also works in 3D.  Setting uniformly random
        orientations in 3D requires a little more thought, but Drake supplies
        the method <code>UniformlyRandomRotationMatrix</code> (and also one for
        quaternions and roll-pitch-yaw) to do that work for us.</p>

        <p><a target="clutter"
          href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/RussTedrake/manipulation/blob/master/clutter.ipynb#scrollTo=GoxjuO5PJlF4"><img

          </p>

        <p>I had to decide how to visualize the results of this one for you. The
        mesh and texture map files for the YCB objects are very large, so
        downloading many of them to your browser from Colab felt a bit too
        painful.  If you've decided to run the notebooks on your local machine,
        then go ahead and run <code>drake_visualizer</code> before running this
        test to see the live simulation (drake visualizer will load the mesh
        files directly from your disk, so avoid the download).  For Colab, I've
        decided to add a camera to the scene and take a picture after the
        simulating for a few seconds.  After all, that's perhaps the data that
        we're actually looking for.</p>

        <figure>
          <img style="width:70%" src="data/ycb_clutter.png"/>
        </figure>

      </example>

      <p>Please appreciate that bins are a particularly simple case for
      generating random scenarios. If you wanted to generate random kitchen
      environments, for example, then you won't be as happy with a solution that
      drops refrigerators, toasters, and stools from uniformly random i.i.d.
      poses.  In those cases, authoring reasonable distributions gets much more
      interesting; we will revisit the topic of generative scene models later in
      the notes.</p>

    </subsection>

    <subsection><h1>Static equilibrium with frictional contact</h1>

      <p>Even in the case of bins, we should try think critically about whether
      dropping objects from a height is really the best solution.  Given our
      discussion in the last chapter about writing optimizations with
      non-penetration constraints, I hope you are already asking yourself: why
      not use those constraints again here?  Let's explore that idea a bit
      further.</p>
  
      <p>I won't dive into a full discussion of multibody dynamics nor multibody
      simulation, though I do have more notes <a
      href="http://underactuated.mit.edu/multibody.html">available here</a>.
      What is important to understand here is that the equations of motion of
      our multibody system are described by differential equations of the form:
      $$M(q)\dot{v} + C(q,v)v = \tau_g(q) + \sum_i J^T_i(q)F^{c_i}.$$  The left
      side of the equation is just a generalization of "mass times
      acceleration", with the mass matrix, $M$, and the Coriolis terms $C$.  The
      right hand side is the sum of the (generalized) forces, with $\tau_g(q)$
      capturing the terms due to gravity, $Bu$ the actuation inputs, and
      $F^{c_i}$ is the <a
      href="https://drake.mit.edu/doxygen_cxx/group__multibody__spatial__vectors.html">spatial
      force</a> due to the $i$th contact.  $J_i(q)$ is the $i$th "contact
      Jacobian" -- it is the Jacobian that maps from the generalized velocities
      to the spatial velocity of the $i$th contact frame.</p>

      <p>Our interest here is in finding (stable) steady-state solutions to
      these differential equations that can serve as good initial conditions for
      our simulation.  At steady-state we have $v=\dot{v}=0$, and conveniently
      all of the terms on the left-hand side of the equations are zero.  This
      leaves us with just the force-balance equations $$\tau_g(q) = - \sum_i
      J^T_i(q) F^{c_i}.$$  But we still need to understand where the contact
      forces come from.</p>

        <p>I've produced a scene with multiple cameras looking at our favorite
        YCB mustard bottle.  I've taken the individual point clouds, converted
        them into Open3d's point cloud format, estimated their normals, merged
        the point clouds, cropped then point clouds (to get rid of the geometry
        from the other cameras), then downsampled the point clouds.  (The order
        is important!)</p>

        <p>I've pushed all of the point clouds to meshcat, but with many of them
        set to not be visible by default.  Use the drop-down menu to turn them
        on and off, and make sure you understand basically what is happening on
        each of the steps.</p>

      </example>

    </subsection>

    <subsection><h1>Estimating normals and local curvature</h1>
    
      <p>It's worth going through the basic estimation of the local geometry in
      a point cloud.  You'll see it has a lot in common with the point cloud
      registration we studied in the last chapter.  Let's think about the
      problem of fitting a plane, in a least-squares sense, to a set of
      points<elib>Shakarji98</elib>. We can describe a plane in 3D with a
      position $p$ and a unit length normal vector, $n$.  The distance between a
      point $p^i$ and a plane is simply given by the magnitude of the inner
      product, $\left| (p^i - p)^T n \right|.$  So our least-squares
      optimization becomes $$\min_{p, n} \quad \sum_{i=1}^N \left| (p^i - p)^T n
      \right|^2, \quad \subjto \quad |n| = 1. $$  Taking the gradient of the
      Lagrangian with respect to $p$ and setting it equal to zero gives us that
      $$p^* = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N p^i.$$ Inserting this back into the
      objective, we can write the problem as $$\min_n n^T W n, \quad \subjto
      \quad |n|=1, \quad \text{where } W = \left[ \sum_i  (p^i - p^*) (p^i -
      p^*)^T \right].$$  Geometrically, this objective is a quadratic bowl
      centered at the origin, with a unit circle constraint.  So the optimal
      solution is given by the (unit-length) eigenvector corresponding to the
      <i>smallest</i> eigenvalue of the data matrix, $W$. And for any optimal
      $n$, the "flipped" normal $-n$ is also optimal.  We can pick arbitrarily
      for now, and then flip the normals in a post-processing step (to make sure
      that the normals all point towards the camera origin).</p>

      <p>What is really interesting is that the second and third
      eigenvalues/eigenvectors also tell us something about the local geometry.
      Because $W$ is symmetric, it has orthogonal eigenvectors, and these
      eigenvectors form a (local) basis for the point cloud.  The smallest
      eigenvalue pointed along the normal, and the <i>largest</i> eigenvalue
      corresponds to the direction of largest curvature (largest deviation from
      the fit plane).  This information can be very useful for finding and
      planning grasps.  <elib>tenPas17</elib> and others before them use is as a
      primary heuristic in generating candidate grasps.</p>
  
      <p>In order to approximate the local curvature of a mesh represented by a
      point cloud, we can use our fast nearest neighbor queries to find a
      handful of local points, and using this plane fitting algorithm on just
      those points.  Then we can repeat that entire procedure for every point in
      the point cloud.  I remember when working with point clouds started to
      become a bigger part of my life, I thought that surely doing anything
      moderately computational like this on every point in some dense point
      cloud would be incompatible with online perception.  But I was wrong! Even
      years ago, operations like this one were often used inside real-time
      perception loops.  (And they pale in comparison to the number of <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLOPS">FLOPs</a> we spend these days
      evaluating large neural networks).</p>

            </p>

        <p>I've coded up the basic least-squares surface estimation algorithm,
        with the query point in green, the nearest neighbors in blue, and the
        local least squares estimation drawn with our RGB$\Leftrightarrow$XYZ
        frame graphic.  You should definitely slide it around and see if you can
        understand how the axes line up with the normal and local curvature.</p>

      </example>
    
      <p>You might wonder where you can read more about algorithms of this type.
      I don't have a great reference for you.  But Radu Rusu was the main author
      of the point cloud library<elib>Rusu11</elib>, and his thesis has a lot of
      nice summaries of the point cloud algorithms of
      2010<elib>Rusu10</elib>.</p>
