<chapter style="counter-reset: chapter 6"><h1>Force Control</h1>

  <p>Over the last few chapters, we've developed a great initial toolkit for
  perceiving objects (or piles of objects) in a scene, planning grasps, and
  moving the arm to grasp.  But there is a lot more to manipulation than
  grasping!</p>

  <p>In fact, the signs have already been there if you were paying close
  attention.  I'm sure that you noticed image number 9954 in my clutter
  segmentation dataset.  Good old <code>09954.png</code>. Just in case you
  happened to miss it, here it is again.</p>

  <figure><img style="width:60%" src="data/09954.png"/></figure>

  <p>I don't know how many of the other 9999 random scenes that we generated are
  going to have this problem, but 9954 makes it nice and clear.  How in the
  world are we going to pick up that "Cheez-it" cracker box with our
  two-fingered gripper?  (I know there are a few of you out there thinking about
  how easy that scene is for your suction gripper, but suction along isn't going
  to solve all of our problems either.)</p>

  <p>Just for fun, I asked my daughter to try a similar task with the
  "two-fingered gripper" I had in my kitchen.  Check out the video below.  The
  manipulation problem just got a lot more interesting!</p>

  <figure><figcaption>My daughter performing a quick approximation of the task.  (video coming soon)</figcaption></figure>

  <p>The term <i>nonprehensile manipulation</i> means "manipulation without
  grasping", and humans do it often.  It is easy to appreciate this fact when we
  think about pushing an object that is too big to grasp (e.g. an office chair).
  But if you pay close attention, you will see that humans make use of
  strategies like sliding and environmental contact often, even when they are
  grasping. These strategies just come to the forefront in non-grasping
  manipulation.</p>

  <p>As we build up our toolkit for prehensile and nonprehensile manipulation,
  one of the things that is missing from our discussion so far, which has been
  predominantly kinematic, has been thinking about forces.  This chapter aims to
  begin that discussion.  By the end, I hope you'll agree that we have a pretty
  satisfying way to flip up that box!</p>
