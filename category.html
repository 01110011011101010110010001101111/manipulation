<chapter style="counter-reset: chapter 7"><h1>Category-Level Manipulation</h1>

<!--
  big question: perception -> control.  what do we pass across that arrow? for a
  uav darting through forests, local geometry is enough. for driving, positions
  of the stop signs, trajectories of the other cars gets you very far
  (predicting the future trajectories of other cars is very hard, though!  and
  there are more layers here, too... is the other driver making eye contact with
  me to signal that it's ok for me to go?). for manipulation?  so far we've
  given two answers.  urdf + pose.  and processed point cloud.

  what is the state of my shirt?  peanut butter on toast?  salad?  chopping
  onions?

  it's a big problem.  I would say it's the biggest reason I'm working on
  manipulation right now.  gets to the very heart of perception + control...
  sweet spot -- try to manipulate the same types of objects we've manipulated so
  far, but generalize to a class / category.  all mugs, all shoes.

  -keypoints as a representation for manipulation 
    kPAM, KETO, S3K
    - self-supervised keypoints
      dense object nets 
      keto (sort of)
    - keypoint networks
      - CPM (lots build on this, including integral pose etc)
      - stacked hourglass
  - NOCS
  - shape completion
    - kpam-sc
    - hermans with pointnet
  - analysis by synthesis (including shape parameters)
    - category-level object pose estimation via neural analysis by synthesis
  - differentiable renderer from Sven Benke, using dense descriptors

    just pose estimation:
    - DeepIM seems best according to ben et al.

  - including control
    - keto
    - visuomotor
    - kpam2.0
    - form2fit

  Ben's summary of my breakdown
  I'd say:
- Detection-based (keypoints)
- Regression-based
- Analysis-by-synthesis for known models (includes things like shape-fitting and rendering-based methods)
- Analysis-by-synthesis while solving for shape jointly (generative) including both NOCS-style stuff as well as differentiable rendering approaches

  <p>What is the right representation for an object?</p>

<p>So far our answer to this question has been pretty narrow.  We've basically asked for a sdf file..</p>

<p>The manipulation tasks that we've considered so far fall into one of two
cases.  In the first case, if we have a small number of objects that we wish to
manipulate, and we have models for those objects, then we have tools to find
them (e.g. via instance segmentation) in a scene, estimate their pose, plan a
grasp, etc.  We could use this pipeline to perform a variety of manipulation
tasks, but the assumption that we have model is quite limiting.  And it's
nontrivial to get models that are sufficient for both simulation and rendering.
The second case we have considered was in the bin picking / clutter clearing
example, where we can pick up almost any object, with no model required, but the
tasks we can accomplish without any object model are quite limited.  So far
we've only dropped things into the other bin.</p>
