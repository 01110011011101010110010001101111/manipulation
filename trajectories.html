<chapter style="counter-reset: chapter 7"><h1>Motion Planning</h1>

  <p>There are a few more essential skills that we need in our toolbox.  In this
  chapter, we will explore some of the powerful methods of kinematic trajectory
  motion planning.</p>

  <div>I'm actually almost proud of making it this far into the notes without
  covering this topic yet.  Writing a relatively simple script for the pose of
  the gripper, like we did in the bin picking chapter, really can solve a lot of
  interesting problems.  But there are a number of reasons that we might want a
  more automated solution:
  <ol><li>When the environment becomes more cluttered, it is harder to write
  such a simple solution, and we might have to worry about collisions between
  the arm and the environment as well as the gripper and the environment.</li>
  <li>If we are doing "mobile manipulation" -- our robotic arms are attached to
  a mobile base -- then even if the workspace is not geometrically complicated,
  it might still be different enough each time we reach that it requires
  automated (but possibly still simple) planning.</li><li>If the robot is
  operating in a simple known environment all day long, then it probably makes
  sense to optimize the trajectories that it is executing; we can often speed up
  the manipulation process significantly.</li>
  </div>

  <p>We'll focus on the problem of moving an arm through space in this chapter,
  because that is the classical and very important motivation.  But I need to
  cover this now for another reason, too: it will also soon help us think about
  programming a more dexterous hand.</p>

  <p>I do need to make one caveat.  Despite having spent time on it myself, I
  actually really dislike the problem formulation of collision-free motion
  planning.  I think that as a whole, robots are too afraid of bumping into the
  world (because things still go wrong when they do).  I don't think humans are
  solving these complex geometric problems every time we reach... even when we
  are reaching in dense clutter (I actually suspect that we are very bad at it).
  I would much rather see robots that perform well even with very coarse /
  approximate plans for moving through a cluttered environment, that are not
  afraid to make incidental contacts, and that can still accomplish the task
  when they do!</p>
